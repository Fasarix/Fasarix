### 📱 Tech Playground

My passion really shines when it comes to **mobile development** 📱 — crafting apps that people love to use.  
On top of that, I’m always curious about the fascinating world of **machine learning** 🤖✨ and how AI is reshaping our future.

### 🎮 When I'm Not Coding...

You’ll often find me:

- Enjoying some seriously delicious food 🍕🍔 (because coding makes you hungry!)  
- Getting lost in hours of YouTube videos 📺 — sometimes educational, sometimes pure entertainment  
- Immersed in epic quests playing **Skyrim** & **Bloodborne** 🗡️🔥 — because every coder needs a good challenge!
